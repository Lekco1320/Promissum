> ***Promissum***, the noun form derived from the Latin verb ***promittō*** (to promise), 
> means something that has been promised.

After losing all files from stepping into the campus of university late last year, I finally realized that
**backup is the best promise to data**, and that's why I set out to begin this program to ensure the safety
of my files to become things that have been promised.

### Capabilities

* Supports cross-devices synchronization including disks, phones, cameras and other MTP devices.
* Sets up custom backup tasks with fine grained control.
* Sets up custom plans to execute backup tasks automatically.
* Provides multiple compare modes to update files by last write time and size.
* Enables a directory to store directories and files that have been updated, and provides automatic custom management.
* Enables rules to exclude unwanted files by search pattern, extension, regex or file size.
* Records all detailed backup information.
