***Backup is the best promise to data.***

After losing all files from stepping into the campus of university late last year, I finally realized this. Watching all my works and memories become zero bytes but not being able to do anything about it is catching up with me, and that's why I set out to begin this program. The program's name *Promissum*, the origin of *Promise* from Latin, means the program should possess the ability to backup important files well, and the followings are what Lekco Promissum can do:

+ Backups specified directories and theirs files to other specified directories.
+ Provides multiple compare modes to update files.
+ Provides plans to execute backup tasks automatically by given settings.
+ Provides choices to cope with files need deleting, such as moving them into a specified folder, marking them with versions, clearing out-dated files periodically and so on.
+ Allows users to set up rules to exclude files that don't need to backup.
+ Records all actions Lekco Promissum does to the files, and be able to output them into Excel documents.

Hope you find Lekco Promissum helpful and submit issues if possible.

***Make data immortal.***
